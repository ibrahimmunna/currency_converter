Run the app:
  - cd server
  - npm install
  - npm start
  
To Run the front and back end individually
  React
  - cd client
  - npm install
  - npm start
  
  Node
  - cd server
  - npm install
  - npm start


I didn't add the dockerfile and test because I'm not good at this and I didn't wanted to create any problem. Hopefully I'll learn these things with you. 
Thanks
